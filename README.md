Hey there! 👋🏻 👩🏼‍💻 
My name is Yulia and I'm a data analyst who's passionate about all things creative and analytical. With a background in graphic design and management, I've developed a unique set of skills that allows me to approach problem-solving in a distinctive way. 
I'm enthusiastic, detail-oriented, and always striving to learn and grow, and I'm proficient in various data analytics tools and languages, thanks to a range of bootcamps, professional certification programs, and personal projects. 
My ultimate goal is to work in a dynamic and collaborative environment where I can contribute to the growth of an organization while continuing to evolve as a data professional. So, if you're looking for someone who's ambitious, enthusiastic, and has a wealth of knowledge, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:yuliavk.git@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub])!
